Overview:
This project is a Java-based ATM Machine Simulation with an advanced GUI using Swing. It provides essential ATM functionalities such as balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, cash deposit, PIN change, and transaction history tracking. The application uses serialization to persist user account data across sessions.


Features:
1. User Authentication: Secure login using a PIN.
2. Balance Inquiry: Check current account balance.
3. Cash Deposit: Add money to the account.
4. Cash Withdrawal: Withdraw money from the account with a balance check.
5. Change PIN: Modify the account PIN securely.
6. Transaction History: View past transactions.
7. Data Persistence: Uses serialization to store and retrieve account data.


Technologies Used:
1. Java: Core language for implementing ATM functionality.
2. Swing: GUI framework for user interface development.
3. Serialization: Data storage and retrieval.


Future Improvements:
1. Implement a database for storing user data securely.
2. Enhance the GUI with better visuals.
3. Add multi-user support.
4. Introduce more security measures, such as OTP verification.
